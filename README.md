# CityDefense
Created the game CityDefense in Unity.

The game is a combination of fruit ninja and tower defense.
Game development is my passion and this game was created for fun and persenal development.
I'm a developer and I worked on this game alone so the graphical aspect of the game is as basic as you can see.
